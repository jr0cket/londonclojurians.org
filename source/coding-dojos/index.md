We currently have two monthly dojos, which are practical events, in London. You can find out more details on the [London Clojurians meetup](https://meetup.com/London-Clojurians/) website.

The purpose of the dojos is to have fun, meet new people, see old friends and learn some clojure along the way.

We also have an article on [how to run a London Clojurians coding dojo](how-to-run-a-london-clojurians-coding-dojo.html)

## FAQ

### How much Clojure do I need to know before I come to a dojo?

None. Really, it’s about learning. The first one you go to may be baffling but you are going to see real people working with real code and that is going to be much more helpful that slogging your way through another chapter of a book.


### What is going to a dojo like?

Dojos are practical and fun sessions. We tend to break into small teams of people and work on problems we’ve chosen that evening, though sometimes someone will prepare something special.

By the end of the evening you should have written at least one line of code even if it is `(println "Hello world!")`.

### What is it like to participate

When you arrive at the dojo there should be a group of friendly welcoming people who are into Clojure already or curious about Clojure. Asking people about Clojure and why they are interested in it is a great ice breaker question if you’ve not been before.

Sometimes there are drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, as well as food of some sort (pizza), but it isn’t essential.

There will be an ideas board where people write down topics or project they are interested in tackling that evening. Usually there is a group of beginners as well who might want to do something like work through problems on [4clojure.com](https://4clojure.com). There is usually a mixed group of experience, so you can usually find a group or activity that will be fun.

You should have about an hour and a half to work with your team on your chosen task for the evening.

After that, there is show and tell, where you can share what you learned with everyone else. Even saying that you had trouble getting things going is useful as then we can all learn where the difficult bits of the language and the environment are.

Don’t forget to post your code to github. So that your team can see what you worked on.

Then we clean up to make things easier for our hosts and go to the pub or go home.

In between dojos, we usually discuss what we did in the dojo on the [London Clojurians Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians).
