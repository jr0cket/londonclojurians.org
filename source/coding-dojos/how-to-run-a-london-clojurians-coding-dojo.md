title: How To Run a London Clojurians Coding Dojo

The aim of the event is that everyone has fun whilst exploring Clojure in a safe and supportive environment.

Typical schedule for a coding dojo event:

18.30 - doors open / food arrives
19.00 - Start the event - welcome everyone and decide on the challenges
21.00 - Show and Tell - gather everyone and give everyone a chance to show what has been learnt

# Organising the event

The [London Clojurians meetup community](https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/) has code dojo events automatically scheduled each month for uSwitch (2nd Monday of the month) and Thoughtworks (last Tuesday of the Month).

2-3 weeks before your event, visit the meetup page for your next event and press the **Announce** button at the top left of the page.

A week before the event, send out a friendly email to the [London Clojurians mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians) reminding them about the event.

# Hosting the event

The host should organise food (usually pizza) and drinks (water, soft & alcoholic) for the event.  Take a look at the meetup event pages the afternoon of the event for the latest numbers.

Food should be booked to arrive 15-20 minutes before the start of the event (usually starting at 7pm, with doors opening at 6.30pm)


# Preparing to Running the code dojo event

Ensure the following items are available before the event
- WiFi details
- Power sockets
- Sticky labels for peoples names
- Whiteboard or large screen and laptop for capturing ideas
- Add the first idea to the board / laptop - eg. 4Clojure Challenges


# Running the code dojo event

## Welcome people to the event
Welcome everyone as they arrive and ask them to write their name on a sticky note.

Let people know about the food and drinks and where the facilities are (toilet, fire escape)

Encourage people to add ideas for the dojo.  There are ideas and previous challenges at http://www.londonclojurians.org/code-dojo/

Ask people if they have Clojure experience, what things there are interested to learn, what they are doing with Clojure if they are already using it, etc.

When you are ready to start, gather everyone around the ideas board and ask everyone to do a simple introduction
- name
- experience with clojure or other languages
- an ice breaker question (e.g. what is your favorite flavour of ice cream?)

## Selecting a challenge and Grouping

We organise everyone into small groups, around 3-4 people per group (any bigger and you spend all your time talking). To do this we all vote on the ideas put on the board for that evening.

Read out each of the ideas on the board and ask the person who suggested it to briefly explain

Take a vote for each idea (people can vote for as many ideas as interests them).   If there is a clear winner that everyone is happy to do, then assemble into groups, ensuring each group has someone with a working Clojure enviroment and enough Clojure experience.

If there are several ideas with many vote, then ote again but this time people can only vote once.  Just vote for the ideas with higher votes from the first round.  The idea with the most votes is the main challenge for the evening.

Help people get into groups of 2-4 people for the idea they want to work on.

> Note: If there is no clear winner, or are groups of that would prefer to do something other than the winning idea, this is perfectly okay.  Each group can do a different thing and its up to each group what they ultimately do.


# Show and Tell

Around 9pm, gather everyone together around a large screen or projector and take it in turns to describe what each group did.

Remind people its not about creating something that worked, but what you learnt in your group that is the most important thing.

Ensure there is a round of applause after each group has presented.

If a group really doesnt want to show, no need to force them.

Encourage people to share their code on GitHub and they can also add their code to the [London Clojurians Github organisation](https://github.com/ldnclj)

Thank everyone for attending and ensure the venue is left as least as clean as before the event started.

Thank you for helping support and continue the events of the London Clojure community.
